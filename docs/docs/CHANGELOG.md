## v1.25.0: Necron

Hey all,

I'm sure you've all been aware that things have been slowing down a little with Anubis development, and I want to apologize for that. A lot has been going on in my life lately (my blog will have a post out on Friday with more information), and as a result I haven't really had the energy to work on Anubis in publicly visible ways. There are things going on behind the scenes, but nothing is really shippable yet, sorry!

I've also been feeling some burnout in the wake of perennial waves of anger directed towards me. I'm handling it, I'll be fine, I've just had a lot going on in my life and it's been rough.

I've been missing the sense of wanderlust and discovery that comes with the artistic way I playfully develop software. I suspect that some of the stresses I've been through (setting up a complicated surgery in a country whose language you aren't fluent in is kind of an experience) have been sapping my energy. I'd gonna try to mess with things on my break, but realistically I'm probably just gonna be either watching Stargate SG-1 or doing unreasonable amounts of ocean fishing in Final Fantasy 14. Normally I'd love to keep the details about my medical state fairly private, but I'm more of a public figure now than I was this time last year so I don't really get the invisibility I'm used to for this.

I've also had a fair amount of negativity directed at me for simply being much more visible than the anonymous threat actors running the scrapers that are ruining everything, which though understandable has not helped.

Anyways, it all worked out and I'm about to be in the hospital for a week, so if things go really badly with this release please downgrade to the last version and/or upgrade to the main branch when the fix PR is inevitably merged. I hoped to have time to tame GPG and set up full release automation in the Anubis repo, but that didn't work out this time and that's okay.

If I can challenge you all to do something, go out there and try to actually create something new somehow. Combine ideas you've never mixed before. Be creative, be human, make something purely for yourself to scratch an itch that you've always had yet never gotten around to actually mending.

At the very least, try to be an example of how you want other people to act, even when you're in a situation where software written by someone else is configured to require a user agent to execute javascript to access a webpage.

Be well,

Xe

PS: if you're well-versed in FFXIV lore, the release title should give you an idea of the kind of stuff I've been going through mentally.

- Add iplist2rule tool that lets admins turn an IP address blocklist into an Anubis ruleset.
- Add Polish locale ([#1292](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1309))
- Fix honeypot and imprint links missing `BASE_PREFIX` when deployed behind a path prefix ([#1402](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/1402))
- Add ANEXIA Sponsor logo to docs ([#1409](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1409))
- Improve idle performance in memory storage
- Add HAProxy Configurations to Docs ([#1424](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1424))

## v1.24.0: Y'shtola Rhul

Anubis is back and better than ever! Lots of minor fixes with some big ones interspersed.

- Fix panic when validating challenges after privacy-mode browsers strip headers and the follow-up request matches an `ALLOW` threshold.
- Expose WEIGHT rule matches as Prometheus metrics.
- Allow more OCI registry clients [based on feedback](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1253#issuecomment-3506744184).
- Expose services directory in the embedded `(data)` filesystem.
- Add Ukrainian locale ([#1044](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1044)).
- Allow Renovate as an OCI registry client.
- Properly handle 4in6 addresses so that IP matching works with those addresses.
- Add support to simple Valkey/Redis cluster mode
- Open Graph passthrough now reuses the configured target Host/SNI/TLS settings, so metadata fetches succeed when the upstream certificate differs from the public domain. ([1283](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1283))
- Stabilize the CVE-2025-24369 regression test by always submitting an invalid proof instead of relying on random POW failures.
- Refine the check that ensures the presence of the Accept header to avoid breaking docker clients.
- Removed rules intended to reward actual browsers due to abuse in the wild.

### Dataset poisoning

Anubis has the ability to engage in [dataset poisoning attacks](https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison) using the [dataset poisoning subsystem](./admin/honeypot/overview.mdx). This allows every Anubis instance to be a honeypot to attract and flag abusive scrapers so that no administrator action is required to ban them.

There is much more information about this feature in [the dataset poisoning subsystem documentation](./admin/honeypot/overview.mdx). Administrators that are interested in learning how this feature works should consult that documentation.

### Deprecate `report_as` in challenge configuration

Previously Anubis let you lie to users about the difficulty of a challenge to interfere with operators of malicious scrapers as a psychological attack:

```yaml
bots:
  # Punish any bot with "bot" in the user-agent string
  # This is known to have a high false-positive rate, use at your own risk
  - name: generic-bot-catchall
    user_agent_regex: (?i:bot|crawler)
    action: CHALLENGE
    challenge:
      difficulty: 16 # impossible
      report_as: 4 # lie to the operator
      algorithm: slow # intentionally waste CPU cycles and time
```

This has turned out to be a bad idea because it has caused massive user experience problems and has been removed. If you are using this setting, you will get a warning in your logs like this:

```json
{
  "time": "2025-11-25T23:10:31.092201549-05:00",
  "level": "WARN",
  "source": {
    "function": "github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/lib/policy.ParseConfig",
    "file": "/home/xe/code/TecharoHQ/anubis/lib/policy/policy.go",
    "line": 201
  },
  "msg": "use of deprecated report_as setting detected, please remove this from your policy file when possible",
  "at": "config-validate",
  "name": "mild-suspicion"
}
```

To remove this warning, remove this setting from your policy file.

### Logging customization

Anubis now supports the ability to log to multiple backends ("sinks"). This allows you to have Anubis [log to a file](./admin/policies.mdx#file-sink) instead of just logging to standard out. You can also customize the [logging level](./admin/policies.mdx#log-levels) in the policy file:

```yaml
logging:
  level: "warn" # much less verbose logging
  sink: file # log to a file
  parameters:
    file: "./var/anubis.log"
    maxBackups: 3 # keep at least 3 old copies
    maxBytes: 67108864 # each file can have up to 64 Mi of logs
    maxAge: 7 # rotate files out every n days
    oldFileTimeFormat: 2006-01-02T15-04-05 # RFC 3339-ish
    compress: true # gzip-compress old log files
    useLocalTime: false # timezone for rotated files is UTC
```

Additionally, information about [how Anubis uses each logging level](./admin/policies.mdx#log-levels) has been added to the documentation.

### DNS Features

- CEL expressions for:
  - FCrDNS checks
  - Forward DNS queries
  - Reverse DNS queries
  - `arpaReverseIP` to transform IPv4/6 addresses into ARPA reverse IP notation.
  - `regexSafe` to escape regex special characters (useful for including `remoteAddress` or headers in regular expressions).
- DNS cache and other optimizations to minimize unnecessary DNS queries.

The DNS cache TTL can be changed in the bots config like this:

```yaml
dns_ttl:
  forward: 600
  reverse: 600
```

The default value for both forward and reverse queries is 300 seconds.

The `verifyFCrDNS` CEL function has two overloads:

- `(addr)`
  Simply verifies that the remote side has PTR records pointing to the target address.
- `(addr, ptrPattern)`
  Verifies that the remote side refers to a specific domain and that this domain points to the target IP.

## v1.23.1: Lyse Hext - Echo 1

- Fix `SERVE_ROBOTS_TXT` setting after the double slash fix broke it.

### Potentially breaking changes

#### Remove default Tencent Cloud block rule

v1.23.0 added a default rule to block Tencent Cloud. After an email from their abuse team where they promised to take action to clean up their reputation, I have removed the default block rule. If this network causes you problems, please contact [abuse@tencent.com](mailto:abuse@tencent.com) and supply the following information:

- Time of abusive requests.
- IP address, User-Agent header, or other unique identifiers that can help the abuse team educate the customer about their misbehaving infrastructure.
- Does the abusive IP address request robots.txt? If not, be sure to include that information.
- A brief description of the impact to your system such as high system load, pages not rendering, or database system crashes. This helps the provider establish the fact that their customer is causing you measurable harm.
- Context as to what your service is, what it does, and why they should care.

Mention that you are using Anubis or BotStopper to protect your services. If they do not respond to you, please [contact me](https://xeiaso.net/contact) as soon as possible.

#### Docker / OCI registry clients

Anubis v1.23.0 accidentally blocked Docker / OCI registry clients. In order to explicitly allow them, add an import for `(data)/clients/docker-client.yaml`:

```yaml
bots:
  - import: (data)/meta/default-config.yaml
  - import: (data)/clients/docker-client.yaml
```

This is technically a regression as these clients used to work in Anubis v1.22.0, however it is allowable to make this opt-in as most websites do not expect to be serving Docker / OCI registry client traffic.

## v1.23.0: Lyse Hext

- Add default tencent cloud DENY rule.
- Added `(data)/meta/default-config.yaml` for importing the entire default configuration at once.
- Add `-custom-real-ip-header` flag to get the original request IP from a different header than `x-real-ip`.
- Add `contentLength` variable to bot expressions.
- Add `COOKIE_SAME_SITE_MODE` to force anubis cookies SameSite value, and downgrade automatically from `None` to `Lax` if cookie is insecure.
- Fix lock convoy problem in decaymap ([#1103](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/1103)).
- Fix lock convoy problem in bbolt by implementing the actor pattern ([#1103](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/1103)).
- Remove bbolt actorify implementation due to causing production issues.
- Document missing environment variables in installation guide: `SLOG_LEVEL`, `COOKIE_PREFIX`, `FORCED_LANGUAGE`, and `TARGET_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE` ([#1086](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1086)).
- Add validation warning when persistent storage is used without setting signing keys.
- Fixed `robots2policy` to properly group consecutive user agents into `any:` instead of only processing the last one ([#925](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/925)).
- Make the `fast` algorithm prefer purejs when running in an insecure context.
- Add the [`s3api` storage backend](./admin/policies.mdx#s3api) to allow Anubis to use S3 API compatible object storage as its storage backend.
- Fix a "stutter" in the cookie name prefix so the auth cookie is named `techaro.lol-anubis-auth` instead of `techaro.lol-anubis-auth-auth`.
- Make `cmd/containerbuild` support commas for separating elements of the `--docker-tags` argument as well as newlines.
- Add the `DIFFICULTY_IN_JWT` option, which allows one to add the `difficulty` field in the JWT claims which indicates the difficulty of the token ([#1063](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1063)).
- Ported the client-side JS to TypeScript to avoid egregious errors in the future.
- Fixes concurrency problems with very old browsers ([#1082](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/1082)).
- Randomly use the Refresh header instead of the meta refresh tag in the metarefresh challenge.
- Update OpenRC service to truncate the runtime directory before starting Anubis.
- Make the git client profile more strictly match how the git client behaves.
- Make the default configuration reward users using normal browsers.
- Allow multiple consecutive slashes in a row in application paths ([#754](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/754)).
- Add option to set `targetSNI` to special keyword 'auto' to indicate that it should be automatically set to the request Host name ([424](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/424)).
- The Preact challenge has been removed from the default configuration. It will be deprecated in the future.
- An open redirect when in subrequest mode has been fixed.

### Potentially breaking changes

#### Multiple checks at once has and-like semantics instead of or-like semantics

Anubis lets you stack multiple checks at once with blocks like this:

```yaml
name: allow-prometheus
action: ALLOW
user_agent_regex: ^prometheus-probe$
remote_addresses:
  - 192.168.2.0/24
```

Previously, this only returned ALLOW if _any one_ of the conditions matched. This behaviour has changed to only return ALLOW if _all_ of the conditions match. I expect this to have some issues with user configs, however this fix is grave enough that it's worth the risk of breaking configs. If this bites you, please let me know so we can make an escape hatch.

### Better error messages

In order to make it easier for legitimate clients to debug issues with their browser configuration and Anubis, Anubis will emit internal error detail in base 64 so that administrators can chase down issues. Future versions of this may also include a variant that encrypts the error detail messages.

### Bug Fixes

Sometimes the enhanced temporal assurance in [#1038](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1038) and [#1068](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1068) could backfire because Chromium and its ilk randomize the amount of time they wait in order to avoid a timing side channel attack. This has been fixed by both increasing the amount of time a client has to wait for the metarefresh and preact challenges as well as making the server side logic more permissive.

## v1.22.0: Yda Hext

> Someone has to make an effort at reconciliation if these conflicts are ever going to end.

In this release, we finally fix the odd number of CPU cores bug, pave the way for lighter weight challenges, make Anubis more adaptable, and more.

### Big ticket items

#### Proof of React challenge

A new ["proof of React"](./admin/configuration/challenges/preact.mdx) has been added. It runs a simple app in React that has several chained hooks. It is much more lightweight than the proof of work check.

#### Smaller features

- The [`segments`](./admin/configuration/expressions.mdx#segments) function was added for splitting a path into its slash-separated segments.
- Added possibility to disable HTTP keep-alive to support backends not properly handling it.
- When issuing a challenge, Anubis stores information about that challenge into the store. That stored information is later used to validate challenge responses. This works around nondeterminism in bot rules. ([#917](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/917))
- One of the biggest sources of lag in Firefox has been eliminated: the use of WebCrypto. Now whenever Anubis detects the client is using Firefox (or Pale Moon), it will swap over to a pure-JS implementation of SHA-256 for speed.
- Proof of work solving has had a complete overhaul and rethink based on feedback from browser engine developers, frontend experts, and overall performance profiling.
- Optimize the performance of the pure-JS Anubis solver.
- Web Workers are stored as dedicated JavaScript files in `static/js/workers/*.mjs`.
- Pave the way for non-SHA256 solver methods and eventually one that uses WebAssembly (or WebAssembly code compiled to JS for those that disable WebAssembly).
- Legacy JavaScript code has been eliminated.
- When parsing [Open Graph tags](./admin/configuration/open-graph.mdx), add any URLs found in the responses to a temporary "allow cache" so that social preview images work.
- The hard dependency on WebCrypto has been removed, allowing a proof of work challenge to work over plain (unencrypted) HTTP.
- The Anubis version number is put in the footer of every page.
- Add a default block rule for Huawei Cloud.
- Add a default block rule for Alibaba Cloud.
- Added support to use Traefik forwardAuth middleware.
- Add X-Request-URI support so that Subrequest Authentication has path support.
- Added glob matching for `REDIRECT_DOMAINS`. You can pass `*.bugs.techaro.lol` to allow redirecting to anything ending with `.bugs.techaro.lol`. There is a limit of 4 wildcards.

### Fixes

#### Odd numbers of CPU cores are properly supported

Some phones have an odd number of CPU cores. This caused [interesting issues](https://anubis.techaro.lol/blog/2025/cpu-core-odd). This was fixed by [using `Math.trunc` to convert the number of CPU cores back into an integer](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/1043).

#### Smaller fixes

- A standard library HTTP server log message about HTTP pipelining not working has been filtered out of Anubis' logs. There is no action that can be taken about it.
- Added a missing link to the Caddy installation environment in the installation documentation.
- Downstream consumers can change the default [log/slog#Logger](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog#Logger) instance that Anubis uses by setting `opts.Logger` to your slog instance of choice ([#864](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/864)).
- The [Thoth client](https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/thoth) is now public in the repo instead of being an internal package.
- [Custom-AsyncHttpClient](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client)'s default User-Agent has an increased weight by default ([#852](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/852)).
- Add option for replacing the default explanation text with a custom one ([#747](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/747))
- The contact email in the LibreJS header has been changed.
- Firefox for Android support has been fixed by embedding the challenge ID into the pass-challenge route. This also fixes some inconsistent issues with other mobile browsers.
- The default `favicon` pattern in `data/common/keep-internet-working.yaml` has been updated to permit requests for png/gif/jpg/svg files as well as ico.
- The `--cookie-prefix` flag has been fixed so that it is fully respected.
- The default patterns in `data/common/keep-internet-working.yaml` have been updated to appropriately escape the '.' character in the regular expression patterns.
- Add optional restrictions for JWT based on the value of a header ([#697](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/697))
- The word "hack" has been removed from the translation strings for Anubis due to incidents involving people misunderstanding that word and sending particularly horrible things to the project lead over email.
- Bump AI-robots.txt to version 1.39
- Inject adversarial input to break AI coding assistants.
- Add better logging when using Subrequest Authentication.

### Security-relevant changes

- Add a server-side check for the meta-refresh challenge that makes sure clients have waited for at least 95% of the time that they should.

#### Fix potential double-spend for challenges

Anubis operates by issuing a challenge and having the client present a solution for that challenge. Challenges are identified by a unique UUID, which is stored in the database.

The problem is that a challenge could potentially be used twice by a dedicated attacker making a targeted attack against Anubis. Challenge records did not have a "spent" or "used" field. In total, a dedicated attacker could solve a challenge once and reuse that solution across multiple sessions in order to mint additional tokens.

This was fixed by adding a "spent" field to challenges in the data store. When a challenge is solved, that "spent" field gets set to `true`. If a future attempt to solve this challenge is observed, it gets rejected.

With the advent of store based challenge issuance in [#749](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/749), this means that these challenge IDs are [only good for 30 minutes](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/blob/e8dfff635015d6c906dddd49cb0eaf591326092a/lib/anubis.go#L130-L135d). Websites using the most recent version of Anubis have limited exposure to this problem.

Websites using older versions of Anubis have a much more increased exposure to this problem and are encouraged to keep this software updated as often and as frequently as possible.

Thanks to [@taviso](https://github.com/taviso) for reporting this issue.

### Breaking changes

- The "slow" frontend solver has been removed in order to reduce maintenance burden. Any existing uses of it will still work, but issue a warning upon startup asking administrators to upgrade to the "fast" frontend solver.
- The legacy JSON based policy file example has been removed and all documentation for how to write a policy file in JSON has been deleted. JSON based policy files will still work, but YAML is the superior option for Anubis configuration.

### New Locales

- Lithuanian [#972](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/972)
- Vietnamese [#926](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/926)

## v1.21.3: Minfilia Warde - Echo 3

### Added

#### New locales

Anubis now supports these new languages:

- [Swedish](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/913)

### Fixes

#### Fixes a problem with nonstandard URLs and redirects

Fixes [GHSA-jhjj-2g64-px7c](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjj-2g64-px7c).

This could allow an attacker to craft an Anubis pass-challenge URL that forces a redirect to nonstandard URLs, such as the `javascript:` scheme which executes arbitrary JavaScript code in a browser context when the user clicks the "Try again" button.

This has been fixed by disallowing any URLs without the scheme `http` or `https`.

Additionally, the "Try again" button has been fixed to completely ignore the user-supplied redirect location. It now redirects to the home page (`/`).

## v1.21.2: Minfilia Warde - Echo 2

This contained an incomplete fix for [GHSA-jhjj-2g64-px7c](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjj-2g64-px7c). Do not use this version.

## v1.21.1: Minfilia Warde - Echo 1

- Expired records are now properly removed from bbolt databases ([#848](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/848)).
- Fix hanging on service restart ([#853](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/853))

### Added

Anubis now supports the [`missingHeader`](./admin/configuration/expressions.mdx#missingHeader) to assert the absence of headers in requests.

#### New locales

Anubis now supports these new languages:

- [Czech](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/849)
- [Finnish](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/863)
- [Norwegian Bokmål](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/855)
- [Norwegian Nynorsk](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/855)
- [Russian](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/882)

### Fixes

#### Fix ["error: can't get challenge"](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/869) when details about a challenge can't be found in the server side state

v1.21.0 changed the core challenge flow to maintain information about challenges on the server side instead of only doing them via stateless idempotent generation functions and relying on details to not change. There was a subtle bug introduced in this change: if a client has an unknown challenge ID set in its test cookie, Anubis will clear that cookie and then throw an HTTP 500 error.

This has been fixed by making Anubis throw a new challenge page instead.

#### Fix event loop thrashing when solving a proof of work challenge

Previously the "fast" proof of work solver had a fragment of JavaScript that attempted to only post an update about proof of work progress to the main browser window every 1024 iterations. This fragment of JavaScript was subtly incorrect in a way that passed review but actually made the workers send an update back to the main thread every iteration. This caused a pileup of unhandled async calls (similar to a socket accept() backlog pileup in Unix) that caused stack space exhaustion.

This has been fixed in the following ways:

1. The complicated boolean logic has been totally removed in favour of a worker-local iteration counter.
2. The progress bar is updated by worker `0` instead of all workers.

Hopefully this should limit the event loop thrashing and let ia32 browsers (as well as any environment with a smaller stack size than amd64 and aarch64 seem to have) function normally when processing Anubis proof of work challenges.

#### Fix potential memory leak when discovering a solution

In some cases, the parallel solution finder in Anubis could cause all of the worker promises to leak due to the fact the promises were being improperly terminated. This was fixed by having Anubis debounce worker termination instead of allowing it to potentially recurse infinitely.

## v1.21.0: Minfilia Warde

> Please, be at ease. You are among friends here.

In this release, Anubis becomes internationalized, gains the ability to use system load as input to issuing challenges, finally fixes the "invalid response" after "success" bug, and more! Please read these notes before upgrading as the changes are big enough that administrators should take action to ensure that the upgrade goes smoothly.

### Big ticket changes

The biggest change is that the ["invalid response" after "success" bug](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/564) is now finally fixed for good by totally rewriting how Anubis' challenge issuance flow works. Instead of generating challenge strings from request metadata (under the assumption that the values being compared against are stable), Anubis now generates random data for each challenge. This data is stored in the active [storage backend](./admin/policies.mdx#storage-backends) for up to 30 minutes. This also fixes [#746](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/746) and other similar instances of this issue.

In order to reduce confusion, the "Success" interstitial that shows up when you pass a proof of work challenge has been removed.

#### Storage

Anubis now is able to store things persistently [in memory](./admin/policies.mdx#memory), [on the disk](./admin/policies.mdx#bbolt), or [in Valkey](./admin/policies.mdx#valkey) (this includes other compatible software). By default Anubis uses the in-memory backend. If you have an environment with mutable storage (even if it is temporary), be sure to configure the [`bbolt`](./admin/policies.mdx#bbolt) storage backend.

#### Localization

Anubis now supports localized responses. Locales can be added in [lib/localization/locales/](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/tree/main/lib/localization/locales). This release includes support for the following languages:

- [Brazilian Portugese](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/726)
- [Chinese (Simplified)](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/774)

If facts or local regulations demand, you can set Anubis default language with the `FORCED_LANGUAGE` environment variable or the `--forced-language` command line argument:

```sh
FORCED_LANGUAGE=de
```

#### Load average

Anubis can dynamically take action [based on the system load average](./admin/configuration/expressions.mdx#using-the-system-load-average), allowing you to write rules like this:

```yaml
## System load based checks.
# If the system is under high load for the last minute, add weight.
- name: high-load-average
  action: WEIGH
  expression: load_1m >= 10.0 # make sure to end the load comparison in a .0
  weight:
    adjust: 20

# If it is not for the last 15 minutes, remove weight.
- name: low-load-average
  action: WEIGH
  expression: load_15m <= 4.0 # make sure to end the load comparison in a .0
  weight:
    adjust: -10
```

Something to keep in mind about system load average is that it is not aware of the number of cores the system has. If you have a 16 core system that has 16 processes running but none of them is hogging the CPU, then you will get a load average below 16. If you are in doubt, make your "high load" metric at least two times the number of CPU cores and your "low load" metric at least half of the number of CPU cores. For example:

|      Kind | Core count | Load threshold |
| --------: | :--------- | :------------- |
| high load | 4          | `8.0`          |
|  low load | 4          | `2.0`          |
| high load | 16         | `32.0`         |
|  low load | 16         | `8`            |

Also keep in mind that this does not account for other kinds of latency like I/O latency. A system can have its web applications unresponsive due to high latency from a MySQL server but still have that web application server report a load near or at zero.

### Other features and fixes

There are a bunch of other assorted features and fixes too:

- Add `COOKIE_SECURE` option to set the cookie [Secure flag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Cookies#block_access_to_your_cookies)
- Sets cookie defaults to use [SameSite: None](https://web.dev/articles/samesite-cookies-explained)
- Determine the `BIND_NETWORK`/`--bind-network` value from the bind address ([#677](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/677)).
- Implement a [development container](https://containers.dev/) manifest to make contributions easier.
- Fix dynamic cookie domains functionality ([#731](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/731))
- Add option for custom cookie prefix ([#732](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/732))
- Make the [Open Graph](./admin/configuration/open-graph.mdx) subsystem and DNSBL subsystem use [storage backends](./admin/policies.mdx#storage-backends) instead of storing everything in memory by default.
- Allow [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) by default so scrapers have less incentive to scrape
- The [bbolt storage backend](./admin/policies.mdx#bbolt) now runs its cleanup every hour instead of every five minutes.
- Don't block Anubis starting up if [Thoth](./admin/thoth.mdx) health checks fail.
- A race condition involving [opening two challenge pages at once in different tabs](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/832) causing one of them to fail has been fixed.
- The "Try again" button on the error page has been fixed. Previously it meant "try the solution again" instead of "try the challenge again".
- In certain cases, a user could be stuck with a test cookie that is invalid, locking them out of the service for up to half an hour. This has been fixed with better validation of this case and clearing the cookie.
- Start exposing JA4H fingerprints for later use in CEL expressions.
- Add `/healthz` route for use in platform-based health checks.

### Potentially breaking changes

We try to introduce breaking changes as much as possible, but these are the changes that may be relevant for you as an administrator:

#### Challenge format change

Previously Anubis did no accounting for challenges that it issued. This means that if Anubis restarted during a client, the client would be able to proceed once Anubis came back online.

During the upgrade to v1.21.0 and when v1.21.0 (or later) restarts with the [in-memory storage backend](./admin/policies.mdx#memory), you may see a higher rate of failed challenges than normal. If this persists beyond a few minutes, [open an issue](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/new).

If you are using the in-memory storage backend, please consider using [a different storage backend](./admin/policies.mdx#storage-backends).

#### Systemd service changes

The following potentially breaking change applies to native installs with systemd only:

Each instance of systemd service template now has a unique `RuntimeDirectory`, as opposed to each instance of the service sharing a `RuntimeDirectory`. This change was made to avoid [the `RuntimeDirectory` getting nuked any time one of the Anubis instances restarts](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/748).

If you configured Anubis' unix sockets to listen on `/run/anubis/foo.sock` for instance `anubis@foo`, you will need to configure Anubis to listen on `/run/anubis/foo/foo.sock` and additionally configure your HTTP load balancer as appropriate.

If you need the legacy behaviour, install this [systemd unit dropin](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/setup/systemd/drop-in-units/):

```systemd
# /etc/systemd/system/anubis@.service.d/50-runtimedir.conf
[Service]
RuntimeDirectory=anubis
```

Just keep in mind that this will cause problems when Anubis restarts.

## v1.20.0: Thancred Waters

The big ticket items are as follows:

- Implement a no-JS challenge method: [`metarefresh`](./admin/configuration/challenges/metarefresh.mdx) ([#95](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/95))
- Implement request "weight", allowing administrators to customize the behaviour of Anubis based on specific criteria
- Implement GeoIP and ASN based checks via [Thoth](https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/thoth) ([#206](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/206))
- Add [custom weight thresholds](./admin/configuration/thresholds.mdx) via CEL ([#688](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/688))
- Move Open Graph configuration [to the policy file](./admin/configuration/open-graph.mdx)
- Enable support for Open Graph metadata to be returned by default instead of doing lookups against the target
- Add `robots2policy` CLI utility to convert robots.txt files to Anubis challenge policies using CEL expressions ([#409](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/409))
- Refactor challenge presentation logic to use a challenge registry
- Allow challenge implementations to register HTTP routes
- [Imprint/Impressum support](./admin/configuration/impressum.mdx) ([#362](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/362))
- Fix "invalid response" after "Success!" in Chromium ([#564](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/564))

A lot of performance improvements have been made:

- Replace internal SHA256 hashing with xxhash for 4-6x performance improvement in policy evaluation and cache operations
- Optimized the OGTags subsystem with reduced allocations and runtime per request by up to 66%
- Replace cidranger with bart for IP range checking, improving IP matching performance by 3-20x with zero heap
  allocations

And some cleanups/refactors were added:

- Fix OpenGraph passthrough ([#717](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/717))
- Remove the unused `/test-error` endpoint and update the testing endpoint `/make-challenge` to only be enabled in
  development
- Add `--xff-strip-private` flag/envvar to toggle skipping X-Forwarded-For private addresses or not
- Bump AI-robots.txt to version 1.37
- Make progress bar styling more compatible (UXP, etc)
- Add `--strip-base-prefix` flag/envvar to strip the base prefix from request paths when forwarding to target servers
- Fix an off-by-one in the default threshold config
- Add functionality for HS512 JWT algorithm
- Add support for dynamic cookie domains with the `--cookie-dynamic-domain`/`COOKIE_DYNAMIC_DOMAIN` flag/envvar

Request weight is one of the biggest ticket features in Anubis. This enables Anubis to be much closer to a Web Application Firewall and when combined with custom thresholds allows administrators to have Anubis take advanced reactions. For more information about request weight, see [the request weight section](./admin/policies.mdx#request-weight) of the policy file documentation.

TL;DR when you have one or more WEIGHT rules like this:

```yaml
bots:
  - name: gitea-session-token
    action: WEIGH
    expression:
      all:
        - '"Cookie" in headers'
        - headers["Cookie"].contains("i_love_gitea=")
    # Remove 5 weight points
    weight:
      adjust: -5
```

You can configure custom thresholds like this:

```yaml
thresholds:
  - name: minimal-suspicion # This client is likely fine, its soul is lighter than a feather
    expression: weight < 0 # a feather weighs zero units
    action: ALLOW # Allow the traffic through

  # For clients that had some weight reduced through custom rules, give them a
  # lightweight challenge.
  - name: mild-suspicion
    expression:
      all:
        - weight >= 0
        - weight < 10
    action: CHALLENGE
    challenge:
      # https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/configuration/challenges/metarefresh
      algorithm: metarefresh
      difficulty: 1
      report_as: 1

  # For clients that are browser-like but have either gained points from custom
  # rules or report as a standard browser.
  - name: moderate-suspicion
    expression:
      all:
        - weight >= 10
        - weight < 20
    action: CHALLENGE
    challenge:
      # https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/configuration/challenges/proof-of-work
      algorithm: fast
      difficulty: 2 # two leading zeros, very fast for most clients
      report_as: 2

  # For clients that are browser like and have gained many points from custom
  # rules
  - name: extreme-suspicion
    expression: weight >= 20
    action: CHALLENGE
    challenge:
      # https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/configuration/challenges/proof-of-work
      algorithm: fast
      difficulty: 4
      report_as: 4
```

These thresholds apply when no other `ALLOW`, `DENY`, or `CHALLENGE` rule matches the request. `WEIGHT` rules add and remove request weight as needed:

```yaml
bots:
  - name: gitea-session-token
    action: WEIGH
    expression:
      all:
        - '"Cookie" in headers'
        - headers["Cookie"].contains("i_love_gitea=")
    # Remove 5 weight points
    weight:
      adjust: -5

  - name: bot-like-user-agent
    action: WEIGH
    expression: '"Bot" in userAgent'
    # Add 5 weight points
    weight:
      adjust: 5
```

Of note: the default "generic browser" rule assigns 10 weight points:

```yaml
# Generic catchall rule
- name: generic-browser
  user_agent_regex: >-
    Mozilla|Opera
  action: WEIGH
  weight:
    adjust: 10
```

Adjust this as you see fit.

## v1.18.0: Varis zos Galvus

The big ticket feature in this release is [CEL expression matching support](https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/configuration/expressions). This allows you to tailor your approach for the individual services you are protecting.

These can be as simple as:

```yaml
- name: allow-api-requests
  action: ALLOW
  expression:
    all:
      - '"Accept" in headers'
      - 'headers["Accept"] == "application/json"'
      - 'path.startsWith("/api/")'
```

Or as complicated as:

```yaml
- name: allow-git-clients
  action: ALLOW
  expression:
    all:
      - >-
        (
          userAgent.startsWith("git/") ||
          userAgent.contains("libgit") ||
          userAgent.startsWith("go-git") ||
          userAgent.startsWith("JGit/") ||
          userAgent.startsWith("JGit-")
        )
      - '"Git-Protocol" in headers'
      - headers["Git-Protocol"] == "version=2"
```

The docs have more information, but here's a tl;dr of the variables you have access to in expressions:

| Name            | Type                  | Explanation                                                                                                                               | Example                                                      |

| `method`        | `string`              | The [HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods) in the request being processed.                    | `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc.                                |
| `path`          | `string`              | The [path](https://web.dev/articles/url-parts#pathname) of the request being processed.                                                   | `/`, `/api/memes/create`                                     |
| `query`         | `map[string, string]` | The [query parameters](https://web.dev/articles/url-parts#query) of the request being processed.                                          | `?foo=bar` -> `{"foo": "bar"}`                               |
| `remoteAddress` | `string`              | The IP address of the client.                                                                                                             | `1.1.1.1`                                                    |
| `userAgent`     | `string`              | The [`User-Agent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent) string in the request being processed. | `Mozilla/5.0 Gecko/20100101 Firefox/137.0`                   |

This will be made more elaborate in the future. Give me time. This is a [simple, lovable, and complete](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/) implementation of this feature so that administrators can get hacking ASAP.

## v1.16.0

Fordola rem Lupis

> I want to make them pay! All of them! Everyone who ever mocked or looked down on me -- I want the power to make them pay!

The following features are the "big ticket" items:

- Added support for native Debian, Red Hat, and tarball packaging strategies including installation and use directions
- A prebaked tarball has been added, allowing distros to build Anubis like they could in v1.15.x

- Added a no-store Cache-Control header to the challenge page
- Hide the directory listings for Anubis' internal static content
- Changed `--debug-x-real-ip-default` to `--use-remote-address`, getting the IP address from the request's socket address instead

- Hash pinned all GitHub Actions

## v1.15.1

Zenos yae Galvus: Echo 1

Fixes a recurrence of [CVE-2025-24369](https://github.com/Xe/x/security/advisories/GHSA-56w8-8ppj-2p4f)
due to an incorrect logic change in a refactor. This allows an attacker to mint a valid
access token by passing any SHA-256 hash instead of one that matches the proof-of-work
test.

This case has been added as a regression test. It was not when CVE-2025-24369 was released
due to the project not having the maturity required to enable this kind of regression testing.

## v1.15.0

Zenos yae Galvus

> Yes...the coming days promise to be most interesting. Most interesting.

Headline changes:

- ed25519 signing keys for Anubis can be stored in the flag `--ed25519-private-key-hex` or envvar `ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX`; if one is not provided when Anubis starts, a new one is generated and logged
- Add the ability to set the cookie domain with the envvar `COOKIE_DOMAIN=techaro.lol` for all domains under `techaro.lol`
- Add the ability to set the cookie partitioned flag with the envvar `COOKIE_PARTITIONED=true`

Many other small changes were made, including but not limited to:

- Fixed and clarified installation instructions
- Introduced integration tests using Playwright
- Refactor & Split up Anubis into cmd and lib.go
- Fixed bot check to only apply if address range matches
- Fix default difficulty setting that was broken in a refactor
- Linting fixes
- Make dark mode diff lines readable in the documentation
- Fix CI based browser smoke test

Users running Anubis' test suite may run into issues with the integration tests on Windows hosts. This is a known issue and will be fixed at some point in the future. In the meantime, use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

- Add explanation of what Anubis is doing to the challenge page [#25](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/25)
- Administrators can now define artificially hard challenges using the "slow" algorithm:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "generic-bot-catchall",
    "user_agent_regex": "(?i:bot|crawler)",
    "action": "CHALLENGE",
    "challenge": {
      "difficulty": 16,
      "report_as": 4,
      "algorithm": "slow"
    }
  }
  ```

  This allows administrators to cause particularly malicious clients to use unreasonable amounts of CPU. The UI will also lie to the client about the difficulty.

- Docker images now explicitly call `docker.io/library/<thing>` to increase compatibility with Podman et. al
  [#21](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/21)
- Don't overflow the image when browser windows are small (eg. on phones)
  [#27](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/27)
- Lower the default difficulty to 5 from 4
- Don't duplicate work across multiple threads [#36](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/36)
- Documentation has been moved to https://anubis.techaro.lol/ with sources in docs/
- Removed several visible AI artifacts (e.g., 6 fingers) [#37](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/37)
- [KagiBot](https://kagi.com/bot) is allowed through the filter [#44](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/44)
- Fixed hang when navigator.hardwareConcurrency is undefined
- Support Unix domain sockets [#45](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/45)
- Allow filtering by remote addresses:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "qwantbot",
    "user_agent_regex": "\\+https\\:\\/\\/help\\.qwant\\.com/bot/",
    "action": "ALLOW",
    "remote_addresses": ["91.242.162.0/24"]
  }
  ```

  This also works at an IP range level:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "internal-network",
    "action": "ALLOW",
    "remote_addresses": ["100.64.0.0/10"]
  }
  ```
